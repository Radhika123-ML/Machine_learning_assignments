    "       2)unsupervised learning-It is branch of machine learning which is used for analysis,here input data is unlabelled.(e.g.when we do not have any prior knowledge of people in a party and we divide them on the basis of various aspects )\n",
    "       \n",
    "       3)reinforcement learning-in this machine learns how to optimally perform in a certain environment.here machine is made to learn using the concept of reward and penelty.it is a constant learning of decision making. (e.g.self driving cars)\n",

    "9. What is the concept of generalization? What function does it play in the machine learning\n",
    "process?\n",
    "answer:generalization is the ability of machine to adapt the new unseen data and forecast,the distribution of unseen data is similar to the distribution of trained data;the function of generalization is to make predictions.\n",

    "answer:classification is a technique under supervised ML.here the data is classified according to the labels which are already known.\n",
    "the difference between classification and regression:\n",
    "classification model predict according to class label,it deals with the categorical data.whereas,\n",
    "regression model deals with the continous data and predict in the form of a quantity.\n",

    "11. What is regression, and how does it work? Give an example of a real-world problem that was\n",
    "solved using regression.\n",
    "answer:regression is a ML model which falls under supervised learning,it predicts the relationship between dependent variable with the independent variable.e.g. finding out the effect of investing on TV,newspaper,radio advertisement on the sales.\n",

    "12. Describe the clustering mechanism in detail.\n",
    "answer:clustering is an unsupervised machine learning technique which is use to cluster the data having similar properties,other clusters formed would have different properties. in clustering we do not have any previous knowledge about the data labels using which it can be grouped.\n",

    "answer:\n",
    "ii. Studying under supervision-in machine learning studying under supervision is considered as supervised learning.here machine makes prediction using the trained dataset.machine is trained in such a way that when there in new unseen data with distribution similar to as that of trained data is fed into the model it gives prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "iii. Studying without supervision-in machine learning studying without any supervision is considered as unsupervised learning. here the unsupervised ML models does the analysis of the data and not the prediction.there is no use of trained dataset in this case also the input data is not labelled beforehand.\n"
